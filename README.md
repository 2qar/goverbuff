# goverbuff
A package for scraping player information from Overbuff.

## Why?
Unofficial APIs that scrape stats from the Blizzard website are nice, but they're only useful when the person's profile isn't private. Overbuff still has stats for private profiles from before the change was made, giving at the very least an estimate of somebody's skill level (even if it's inaccurate).
